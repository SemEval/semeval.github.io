## What is SemEval?

__SemEval__ is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. 
Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared.

SemEval is sponsored by the [SIGLEX](http://alt.qcri.org/siglex/) Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

## [SemEval-2021](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/)

The 15th edition of SemEval features [tasks](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/tasks.html) ranging from prediction of lexical complexity to learning with disagreements, and including several cross-lingual and multi-modal tasks.

The evaluation period took place in January 2021. See the [SemEval-2021 homepage](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2021/) for details.

The workshop is taking place August 5â€“6, 2021 in Bangkok, Thailand, colocated with [ACL-IJCNLP 2021](https://2021.aclweb.org/).
