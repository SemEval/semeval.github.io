## What is SemEval?

__SemEval__ is a series of international natural language processing (NLP) research workshops whose mission is to advance the current state of the art in semantic analysis and to help create high-quality annotated datasets in a range of increasingly challenging problems in natural language semantics. 
Each year's workshop features a collection of shared tasks in which computational semantic analysis systems designed by different teams are presented and compared.

SemEval is sponsored by the [SIGLEX](http://alt.qcri.org/siglex/) Special Interest Group on the Lexicon of the Association for Computational Linguistics.

## [SemEval-2025](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2025/)
The [__call for task proposals__](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2025/cft) is open!


## [SemEval-2024](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2024/)

The 18th edition of SemEval features [__10 TASKS__](https://semeval.github.io/SemEval2024/tasks.html) on a range of topics, including tasks on idiomaticy detection and embedding, sarcasm detection, multilingual news similarity, and linking mathematical symbols to their descriptions. Several tasks are multilingual, and others ask for multimodal approaches. 

For all tasks, some sample data is already available. Take a look at the individual task websites for more detailed information.

## Anti-Harassment policy

SemEval highly values the open exchange of ideas, freedom of thought and expression, and respectful scientific debate. We support and uphold the [NAACL Anti-Harassment policy](http://naacl.org/policies/anti-harassment.html). Participants are encouraged to send any concerns or questions to the [NAACL Board members](http://naacl.org/officers/), [Priscilla Rasmussen](mailto:acl@aclweb.org) and/or the workshop organizers.
